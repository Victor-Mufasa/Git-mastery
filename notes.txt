When you compress a folder to a zipped folder its contents size reduces to 15-25% its original size.
A gzip file also reduces the file size but not as much as a 7zip does.
A WINRAR file does not reduce a file size but archives it.
A bit, nibble and byte and word are all ways in which computers communicate.
Computers are fascinating machines.
